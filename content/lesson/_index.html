<p>Each class session has an interactive lesson that you will work through <strong><em>after</em></strong> doing the readings and watching the lecture. These lessons are a central part of the class—they will teach you how to use <strong>ggplot2</strong> and other packages in the <strong>tidyverse</strong> to create beautiful and truthful visualizations with R.</p>
<p>Interactive code sections look like this. Make changes in the text box and click on the green “Run Code” button to see the results. Sometimes there will be a button with a hint or solution.</p>
<div class="puzzle">
<p><strong>Your turn</strong>: Modify the code here to show the relationship between health and wealth for 2002 instead of 2007.</p>

<p>If you’re curious how this works, each interactive code section is a miniature <a href="https://shiny.rstudio.com/">Shiny</a> app hosted at <a href="https://www.shinyapps.io/">shinyapps.io</a>. Each app uses <a href="https://rstudio.github.io/learnr/"><strong>learnr</strong></a> to provide interactivity, and these <strong>learnr</strong> apps are embedded in this website with some <a href="https://desiree.rbind.io/post/2020/learnr-iframes/">HTML and Javascript wizardry</a>.</p>
