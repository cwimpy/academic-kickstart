## `Stata` Assignment #4

1. Estimate a multiple regression model using the data of your choice (previous work is allowable). The model must include at least two continuous predictors and one dummy variable on the right-hand side.

2. Conduct `Stata`'s test for heteroskedasticity and interpret the results. 

3. Estimate another model in which you specify/test an interactive hypothesis. 

4. Interpret the model with point estimates, confidence intervals, and graphical methods. How does you interaction turn out? 

5. Copy your code, interpretations, and output to a Word document and save as a PDF. E-mail the PDF to Dr. Wimpy by next Monday @11:59 p.m. Note, if you use a Stata log file, you can just save that as a PDF and send it to Dr. Wimpy instead of a Word document.
