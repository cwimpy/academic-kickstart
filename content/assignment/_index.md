You will get the most of out this class if you:

1. Complete all of the readings and pay attention to the lectures
2. Really learn to use `Stata`

All of the assignments are designed to help with one of these goals. 

## `Stata` Assignments

Each week you will be asked to complete one or more assignments in `Stata`. These are graded on a good-faith effort basis so please give them a go. 

## Topical Assignments

We will also be completing assignments based on the substantive class materials. I give partial credit on these, but right answers will yield better scores. 

## Submitting Assignments 

 **All assignments that require document submission must have filenames that follow this convention: `your last name_assignment#.file extension`.** As an example for myself and assignment one, I would do the following: `wimpy_assignment1.pdf`. Failure to follow this convention will be met first with a warning, second with ten points off, and finally a zero after the third time. All assignments are due via email to Dr. Wimpy on the Sunday before class at 11:59 p.m.
