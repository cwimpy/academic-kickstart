You will get the most of out this class if you:

1. Complete all of the readings and pay attention to the lectures
2. Really learn to use `Stata`

All of the assignments are designed to help with one of these goals. 

## `Stata` Assignments

Each week you will be asked to complete one or more assignments in `Stata`. These are graded on a good-faith effort basis so please give them a go. 

## Topical Assignments

We will also be completeing assignments based on the substantive class materials. I give partial credit on these, but right answers will yield better scores. 

## Submitting Assignments 

You will submit your assignments
