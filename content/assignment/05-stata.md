## `Stata` Assignment #5

1. Go through the following steps:

- Find a time series data set (on a single spatial unit) on the web. Start a do-file, load the data set into Stata, and make a proper time variable for it.
- Pick one of the variables in this data set.
- Start a word processing document in which you describe where you found this variable and go through the basic steps of getting to know this variable.
- Graph this variable across time. (use `tsline` after `tsset`)
- Write a short description of the variation of this variable across time.
- Go through steps to test for the order of integration for this variable.
- Write a short description of what you have found.
- Copy your code, interpretations, and output to a Word document and save as a PDF. E-mail the PDF to Dr. Wimpy by next Monday @11:59 p.m. Note, if you use a Stata log file, you can just save that as a PDF and send it to Dr. Wimpy instead of a Word document.
