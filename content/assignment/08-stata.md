## `Stata` Assignment #7

1. Find a dataset you are interested in. Identify a binary outcome variable and summarize it. 

2. Estimate a logistic regression model with your variable plus at least three independent variables.
3. Provide a detailed interpretation of the model including at least one graph.

4. Copy your code, interpretations, and output to a Word document and save as a PDF. E-mail the PDF to Dr. Wimpy by next Monday @11:59 p.m. Note, if you use a Stata log file, you can just save that as a PDF and send it to Dr. Wimpy instead of a Word document.
