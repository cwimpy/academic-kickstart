## `Stata` Assignment #3

1. Estimate a multiple regression model using the data of your choice (previous work is allowable). The model must include two continuous predictors and one dummy variable on the right-hand side.

2. Conduct at least two post-estimation diagnostic procedures in `Stata`. Interpret what you find and what it means, if anything, for any inferences you may draw from your model.

3. Copy your code, interpretations, and output to a Word document and save as a PDF. E-mail the PDF to Dr. Wimpy by 11:59 p.m. Note, if you use a Stata log file, you can just save that as a PDF and send it to Dr. Wimpy instead of a Word document.
