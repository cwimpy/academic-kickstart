## `Stata` Assignment #9

1. Find a dataset you are interested in. Identify an ordered, multinomial, or count outcome variable and summarize it. 

2. Estimate an ordered, multinomial, or count regression model with your variable plus at least three independent variables.

3. Provide a detailed interpretation of the model including at least one graph.

4. Copy your code, interpretations, and output to a Word document and save as a PDF. E-mail the PDF to Dr. Wimpy by next Monday @11:59 p.m. Note, if you use a Stata log file, you can just save that as a PDF and send it to Dr. Wimpy instead of a Word document.
