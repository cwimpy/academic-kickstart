## `Stata` Assignment #2

1. Download the example data and Do file [here](https://www.dropbox.com/sh/85pwlvuvra0y2ry/AAD3Gkgfl2-aY4966PGKuasga?dl=1). 

2. Using the example as a template, find a dataset that interests you and go through the same process as the exampleâ€”running each command along the way. 

3. Copy your code, interpretations, and output to a Word document and save as a PDF. E-mail the PDF to Dr. Wimpy by 11:59 p.m. Note, if you use a Stata log file, you can just save that as a PDF and send it to Dr. Wimpy instead of a Word document.
