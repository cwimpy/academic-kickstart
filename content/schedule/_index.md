This is our plan for the semester, although it is subject to change if we move to online instruction:

Every course meeting has three important sections. You should read about the details for each using the main menu at the top of this webpage. I will make sure each relevant piece is available prior to our course meeting for each week. 

- [**Content**](/content/) (<i class="fas fa-book-reader"></i>): This page contains the readings, slides, and any other substantive materials for the topic. Please read these materials prior to each meeting. 
- [**Example**](/example/) (<i class="fas fa-laptop-code"></i>): This page contains fully annotated `Stata` code that you can use as a reference for creating your own visualizations. This is only a reference pageâ€”you don't have to necessarily do anything here. This page will be *very* helpful as you work on your assignments.
- [**Assignment**](/assignment/) (<i class="fas fa-pencil-ruler"></i>): This page contains the instructions for either the weekly assignments. **Assignments are due by 11:59 PM on the Monday immediately preceding our class meeting on Tuesdays.**

**tl;dr**: You should follow this general process each week:

- Do everything on the content (<i class="fas fa-book-reader"></i>) page
- Complete the assignment (<i class="fas fa-pencil-ruler"></i>) while referencing the example (<i class="fas fa-laptop-code"></i>)
