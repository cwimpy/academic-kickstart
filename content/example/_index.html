<p>This section contains fully annotated R code that you can use as a reference for creating your own visualizations. In the lessons section, you sequentially build up your understanding of R and <strong>ggplot2</strong>; here you can see how all the pieces work together.</p>
<p>Visit this section after you have finished the readings, lecture videos, and lesson. The examples here will be indispensable for you as you work on your assignments and mini projects.</p>
<p>Each section also contains videos of me live coding the examples so you can see what it looks like to work with R in real time. You’ll notice me make all sorts of little errors, which <em>is totally normal</em>—everyone does!</p>
